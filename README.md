# CO2-Emissions
CO2 Emissions data for countries in the UK

In this project, I used Tableau to explore and visualize emissions data across the United Kingdom. The dashboard presents key insights into how greenhouse gas emissions vary by region, sector, and over time, enabling a clearer understanding of the UK's environmental impact.

Key features:
Interactive maps showing regional emissions distribution

Time-series charts tracking emissions trends over multiple years

Sector breakdowns to highlight major contributors to emissions

Clean, user-friendly design to support data-driven storytelling

This project helped me strengthen my skills in data visualization, dashboard design, and presenting complex datasets in a clear, interactive format.
